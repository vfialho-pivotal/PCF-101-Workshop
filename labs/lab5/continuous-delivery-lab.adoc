= CF Workshop Continuous Delivery Lab

== Intro

This lab will guide you through building a *BASIC* continuous delivery pipeline using Jenkins and Cloud Foundry.

== Initial Setup

. Fork the Spring-Music repository. If you do not have a github account, you can skip this step and use my repository.

  `https:\\https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music.git`
  
. Edit the manifest.yml at the root of the forked spring-music repository. Change the *host* from ${random-word} to your initials. Jenkins does not like the special characters in the host field and will give an error.
  
. Login to your Jenkins instance at https://jenkins-0.pcfsony.com with the same username and password that you use for CloudFoundry.

. Navigate to your username folder.

. Click *Configure* and then *Credentials*, and enter your CloudFoundry credentials. Then click *Save*.


== Create the Build Job

. Click *New Item*, give it the name *spring-music* and select ``Build a free-style software project.'' Then click +OK+.

===== Configure Git

. Under *Source Code Management*, select *Git*, and supply your repository URL (e.g. `https://github.com/<YOUR_GIT_USERNAME>/spring-music`). Leave credentials as *none*.

===== Configure CF Push

. Select *Add Post-build Action* and then *Push to CloudFoundry*.
